This blog has been a smattering of posts about my hobbies and interests over the years. It's been chaotic at best, and unmaintained at worst. The latter led me to the dumpster fire of today and a potential to just drop this and walk away; but, I've never been good at walking away from a challenge. With some rework, I've managed to get the blog updated to the latest version, perform some additional hardening, and get this first post up.

Over the coming week, posts should start to reappear with their original links functioning, but that will take some serious work and I don't suspect I'll actually get it done in the timeline I've set out. Until then, you can [subscribe](https://popebp.com/feed.xml) to stay up to date or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/kxkwXN3rdR).

Until then, stay frosty.
