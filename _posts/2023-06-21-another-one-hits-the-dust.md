title: And another one hits the dust...

It's only been a year that I moved my server to a new location from the original data center it was colocated at.
fter running a battery of updates this past week without thoroughly testing the update plan, I found myself in a
bit of a pickle. The server isn't working and needs some work. In the meantime this is the new blog location, and
I'll probably ultimately move the entire blog here.
